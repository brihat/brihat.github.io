Bṛhat is a Sanskrit word which means big, great, abundant, strong and powerful.
It is pronounced roughly as brihat ( [IPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:IPA_for_Sanskrit): br̩-hat̪ ).

I mostly write about software, programming languages and scientific computing.
Sometimes about natural languages and philosophy.
