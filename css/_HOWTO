Devanagari and Kannada fonts are directly downloadable from here: https://www.google.com/fonts/earlyaccess

For NotoSans: 
https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Noto+Sans

Choose the charsets you need (probably untick Greek & Cyrillic)

The following opens a CSS file
  http://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Noto+Sans&subset=latin,latin-ext

From the above URL you'll get another URL for the .woff font!
Just download it and put it :)

BUT: Note that NotoSans doesn't have Latin Extended Additional,
     but it has all the combining diacritics. So, in emacs,
        M-x ucs-normalize-NFD-region
     and then it works
